- Not just investing, feeling like founder.

- http://www.guygamzu.com/  **contacting to Guy**

- He has a package for startups starting their business

- What to expect to Angels

  - High velocity
  - Depends of each person, too types, low touching more investing number, high touching less investing number
  - Pitching is future selling: telling a story of future is the key point, if not you'll never get funded

- Iclick

  - projetion technology for children
  - first for a more in a wider range, then found the kids enjoy them most

- Eaglys

  - Focusing on what you want the listeners to bring home
  - storing telling good, the financing
  - Too much information, only one use case, make eager the listener with an analogy, why this can change the world and how large it is. Just make it as a magic. How is the secondary,
  - what if a single word is deprecated
  - **structure your story, it's not taking**  to make it qualier

  - key words ,

  - more about the product vision

  - Too soft, 'what can I help him?', so say more details about what you need and why you are telling them. And make examples that help telling that.

  - Give a picture of the future grouth, what's next.

  -  first, maximize the value for small number of people

    ​

  ​

- what would you do for a longer presentation

  - quality

- Maruyama: scaring part is too boring

  - find out a different part for others, that is interesting
  - Make difference from not only your people, all who you met.
  - Opening up

#### Zohar Zisapel

- Japan, not antreprenours, Israel not good at big industries
- He knows better, we can do it if someone can, Japanese has the opposite  
- Strategic not so much, too slow,
- Big companies
  - Big companies are better! but,,,,
  - Longer and slower movements, politics, just local interested are conciderated,
  - How to deal it: brainstorming, competitions, VCs → even so fail.
  - The company is managed by the customers, can't make any change freely
  - The new market is too small for them, thus Toyota didn't take a look at E cars
- he started with startups, RAD
  - even in Israel, that time there wasn't any VCs
  - computers cellphone and internet changed all the communication industry
  - He mede a group of startups in this chaos.
  - but after 2000, this change stoped and became satiable industry (until these days)
  - Even him, couldn't understand that the big componies got the powers in that era
- How to find a startup field: Find a change
  - so cyber security field
    - more pc, connected, clouds, (also the cars)
    - attackers can attack in any contries and governments doesn't coorporate to pretend them.
- automobile is the change
  - E, connected→autonomous, sharing
  - even so it hasn't chaged in long time for now
  - car driving will be rading horse
  - Tesla: chose sport car, with small battery and needs good accelaration, which is good for batery cost and its advantage
  - it will become a world that no one has responsavility on acssidents
  - first, starts in some fields which
    - the easiest field
    - and the most utilized field
  - to start then to full auto
- sharing
  - easier so faster
  - so also thier is not protection from copying
- see the next, and what your bussiness will do there
- **what is your difference** is the keypoint he sees when investing

#### Dinner at HouseIn

- https://www.google.com/maps?q=32.158931,34.808969&hl=ja-JP&gl=jp

### 12/24

#### Academic lecture: *Alon Rosen*

![Alon Rosen](./assets/AlonRosen.jpg)

- Prof, ? , MIT, protocols, NOW IDC Herzliya
- Zvika FHE inventor
- Elette Homographic secret sharing
- Format-preserving Encryption
- E voting
  - the difficulty is privacy and accuracy
  - encryption makes a balance on those two
- voting in US
  - 8 years ago, still using machine
  - 1 in 10 people wasn't counted
  - 70% using 塗りつぶし型
  - 間違えて押しちゃった人が多い疑惑でブッシュ勝つ
- voting electronic machine
  - actually doesn't change at all
  - not transparency
- the problem in paper and electric is both has an blackbox after voting
- if an attacker would attack, they would at the weakest point
-  the difficulty is privacy and accuracy and encryption makes a balance on those two
- only care about that the sum is correct and your inside it
- wombat voting project
- **zero knowledge**
  - can tell there is no knowledge leek without defining knowledge
  - proof: a method for eastablishing truth
  - I did a Q to Alon and get the response, I attach all
    - Q: When using the ZN proof to wombat voting project, is the problem ‘Are all the same votes after they were mixed?’? I understood like this, so that without reveling all the votes, you can prove that they weren’t reduced, added nor changed.
    - A: Regarding your question about the statement proved in ZK in mixnets, it is an NP statement of the form:  L = {(c_1,...,c_N), (d_1,...,d_N) | c_i's are the input ciphertexts and d_i's are the output ciphertexts and there exist a permutation pi: [N]->[N] so that for all i in [N]  it holds that Dec(d_{pi(i)}) = Dec(c_i)}  (Here the "secret" NP witness is pi, and also implicitly the randomness r_i used to generate c_i and s_i used to generate d_i.)  The ZK proof will hide pi and the r_i's and s_i's and convince the verifier that the multiset of votes that are encrypted in (c_1,...,c_N) is identical to the multiset of the votes encrypted in (d_1,...,d_N) (which in particular guarantees that the tally is the same).

#### How Investors think? :  *Izhar Shay*

![Izhar Shay](./assets/IzharShay.jpg)

- primesense : he invested. the base of kinect  and was bought by Apple
- He used to be elctronic engineer and became investor at canaan in first US, then israel
- there are many types divided on stage, sectors and geography(so that they can stay close to the companies)
- invester needs speed
- invester needs money
- invester needs impact
- the global startup ecosystem ranking : https://startupgenome.com/reports/2018/GSER-2018-v1.1.pdf
- hot trends: fin-tech, cyber security, IoT, autonomous drive, crypto currency
- impact could be mejored and is growing,
- examples
  - ad to e sports
  - robots cleaning buildings windows
  - delivery with drones
  - IoT healthcare cyber
  - fishing protection
  - *smell and tattoo*         **winner**
- How long time does the VCs have?
  - Normally, VCs set a time limit, about 10 years.
  - ask how long ago the fund was established
- today's conern
  - economic
  - US and China
  - US politocs
  - north cores, Russia, Iran
  - Mid-East tensions

#### equivio:  *Amir Milo*

![](./assets/AmirMilo.jpg)

- リーンスタートアップ系: many interviews

​

- entrepreneur

- equivio is a text managing AI company

- background in computer mathematics

- working in Microsoft and also funding some companies

- Israel : informal and small atmospher

- hard work for the happy-end

- one conference

  - He met a lady that said that the layers are having problems with the legal documents that had to be read — millions of it.

  - nearly 20 to 40% of documents are near documents(very similar ones)

  - by

    - grouping them and dividing between the layers
    - email to tree

  - 50% of time saving

  - However, what was the purpose of reading the documents at all??

  - Then started scoring the docs by machine learning

  - If you need high accuracy, you need x% to read to have the 90% of the relevant docs, while if not just read 5%

  - How much would that save money? You should find an exact price.

  - Focus on one, you're a small company

    ​

- when doing interview to customers

  - people say yes, than No and I don't know
  - even, these interviews are good for presenting to VCs
  - How you're going to use it, workflow

- market leader

  - 20 to 30% of market
  - How to be one?
  - Segmentation:  divide the product depended on the market. Start with small markets, get them and then make the next segmentation.

- Diside which feature you DONT do.

  - If you're asking 'is this feature going to be used at all?'', don't make it.
  - Co-funder and mentor

- AIRev presentation

  - Focus

- 経営企画室を攻撃の対象に

#### Dinner at 'Kyoto'

#### An intro to Fully Homomorphic Encryption: *Dr. Brakerski*

![](./assets/ZvikaBrakerski.jpg)

- No undergraduates
- *How much your life is on the cloud?*
- when sending your data to an outsorcing computation, you want to send an Enc(x),return Enc(f(x)) so that the server could know nothing and you colud get f(x) = Dec(Enc(f(x)))
- NAND  is universal which means that  with NAND you can compute any circuit
- you even can't know if the enc has information or hasn't. $Enc(x)\\cong Enc(0)$
- not just this for application
- besides Gnetry made FHE, the application was
- approximate eigenvectors: $\\vec{s}\\cdot C =\\vec{e}+ x\\vec s\\sim x\\vec  s$
- but the noise will grow, especially when multiplicating
- $G\\cdot bits(C)=C$
- so, when definig $\\vec s \\cdot C \\simeq  x\\cdot \\vec s G$ ,can do multiplicating by $C_{mult}=C_1\\cdot G^{-1}(C_2)$ and because $G^{-1}(C)$ is  small, the noise won't growth too much
- only issue: *Circular security* issue
- Multi-key FHE
- Quantum FHE
  - BJ15,DSS16,M18a
  - Hybrid Enc. Approach [BJ15] but to universal
  - Fully QFHE [M18a] but hard to add
- Constructing from Learning with Errors
  - used to be an matemathics problem and started to be used as security barrier.
  - $Enc(x)\\simeq Enc(0)$ How to do this? : Bootstrap. Make an A,$\\eta\\sim0$ that $\\vec{s}A=\\eta$  and a random and small R so that  $\\vec s \\cdot C \\simeq \\vec s \\cdot (AR + xG)=(\\vec s \\cdot A)R + \\vec s\\cdot xG\\simeq \\vec s\\cdot xG$. This makes the $C$ toltaly random not depending on x(=0 or 1). Then, to decrypt, because G and $\\vec s$ are big, if $x = 0$ , $\\vec s\\cdot xG\\sim0$ while if $x=1$, it would be a bigger matrix , so you can
  -  squentialization: The error when multiplication $\\vec e_{mult}= \\vec e_1 \\cdot G^{-1}(C_2)+x_1\\vec e_2$ became smaller when $\\vec e_1<<\\vec e_2$ rather than the other way. The longer circuit makes larger noise, so when doing  many calculations, sequentialized is better than paralleled.
  - Barrington's Theorem: Memory could be replaced with Depth
  - The error end up being just $4^d$ for a depth of d, instead of $(N-1)^d$ that
- Multi-Key construction
- Scale Invariance
  - the error scale doesn't affect, the ration does
  - before, the error expands with  $\\vec e_1 \\cdot G^{-1}(C_2)$, but the error became $e^2$ and a multiplication with something in $O(N)$.
- The Ring Setting
  - make a polynomial that makes a ring

- Introduction to secure computation: *Elette Boylo*
  - Encryption on Lovers
  - Computation indistinguishable : $\\cong$
    - no one can tell which is which if both are given differently
  - OT
    - sends the pkey wich the bit you want and another pkey but one that you don't have the skey
    - You can make complete for secure computation
    - only revealing $a\\and b$

### 12/26

#### Introduction to secure computation: *Elette Boylo*

![](./assets/EletteBoyle.jpg)

- One side doesn't learn nothing
- Linearly function: $a_A + a_B = a$として情報を分散
- Hiding each input, can calculate
  - adding(or) by just normal adding
  - multiplication(and) by using OT
    - random shares
    - kind of quantom computing(雰囲気)
    - but needs some communications between
  - Garbled circuits
    - not only for secure computing, also for knowing if who computes did the right function
  - the classic methods need too much communication bits
- Homomorphic Secret Sharing
  - Not-linear functions
  - not only sending numbers or imformations, also function sendings
  - also for voting(updating the server)
    - $f_A(j)+f_B(j)=f_{i,1}(j)$より，自分がどこに投票したのかわからないまま，最後に足し合わせることにより投票結果は計算できる
- Contractions
  - pseudorandom function
    - the undestinguishness of the difference between the truly random fiction and the real function(encryption)
    - PSG is an func that duble one total random seed
    - GGM is a tree of random rows made from a random seed by PSG
    - $\\Delta=S_1+S_2$,so that when the difference disappears, the next b become 0
  - RMS
    - the multiplication is only allowed between any output and the first input
    - the red dots can be selected freely, while if they are too sparse, the steps will be longer and took time, on the other hand, if they are more close, there would be more error dut to stuck one in the middle of the two.

#### Format-Preserving Encryption 1, Intro and Def: *Mor Weiss*

![](./assets/MorWeiss.jpg)

- story
  - T-Mobile's clould were attacked and leaked the Social Security and ID number
- deterministic
  - no randomizing function on encryption
  - can see if they are the same
- Tweakable
  - dictionary attack
    - for deterministic enc., if you know one time the dec. of an X, the next time you see them, you already find that that is X
    - only way to recover is to change the key
  - solution: Tweak
    - use an additional information called Tweak Space and use to encrypt
    - kind of public key and secret key
- Format-Preserving Encryption *FPE*
  - problem
    - applications won't be used at all
    - need different type of table
  - solution: so make the space(format) of the message and the cryptography space be the same
    - if not, just returns error
  - pseudorandom privacy
  - single point indistinguishability
    - weaker
    - indistinguishable between actual cyfertext and random cyfertext
    - ?? 自然言語のFormat-Preserving Encryption
  - Message Privacy
    - with the ciphertext  you can't assume any function of the message
  - Message Recovery
    - with the ciphertext  you can't assume the message
  - PRP $\\Leftrightarrow$ SPI $\\Rightarrow$ MP $\\Rightarrow$  MR
- Constructing
  - purpose: make a universal method to make a FPE
  - Int-FPE
  - Feistel Network
    - 噛ませる関数Fは逆演算不可能でもいい(暗号なのに)
  - Generalize
    - for $\\Z_{ab}$
    - for $\\{1,...,m-1\\}^n$
- General Format
  - Social numbers don't have 666xxxxxx
  - What to do if the encryption is 666xxxxxx? :  encrypt again!
  - the same in date: ddmmyyyy
  - the efficiency: average = rate of the valid space
  - with ranking anything you want, any type colud be designed
- Rank and Unrank
  - ranking bad could make a security problem

####  Dinner

- At the apartment with Asahi sensei
- Maruyamasan and Imabayashisan made Yakiniku and kind of Yakimeshi
- Good cheese

#### Masada

- Where many Judas was besided for 3 years.
- When was finally broken the entrance, decided to suicide
- 10 men killed almost of the resident, then dicided who kill the other 9 using lottery.

- Total Available Market $\\supset$ Saervise Available Market $\\supset$Service Obtainable Market

- Market Research

  - Proper Objective Research
  - Primary research
    - Observation
      - Easiest but could make some bias
    - Focus groups
      - Also could make bias
      - Better than observation because we can choose who to do the research
    - In-Depth Interviews
      - Interview to experter on some people
    - Questionarios
      - Difficult to see who they are
  - Secondary Research
    - Research on the Internet
    - Not random, using **Competitors and Government reports**
    - The newest report could be expensive, so use one or two year older one

  1. Ask the customers what they wan
  2. Ask the customers who theu dream of
  3. Talk to 'non-customers'
  4. Talk to competitors
     - in seminors, events without identifying your purpose clearly
  5. Understand the competitors buissiness model
     - as a late comer, you should be 10 times better
  6. Know the positioning map of the industry
  7. Talk to distributors
     - Knows the customers and their needsz
  8. $\\large Test$

  - STP

  - Segmentation

    - Understanding the customers need
    - First dicide some axis and evaluate

  - Targeting

    - Select which customer to aim

  - Positionning

  - Eaglys segmantation

    - People who want to utilize sensitive data

      ​

- segment and target the best one, then do all

- Market potential

  - Type of customer
  - Where
  - How many
  - How often
  - Competition
  - Price
  - Growth
  - My share

  1. define target market
  2. geographic buondaries
  3. average expenditures for the category
  4. average household income in the area
  5. $MP = N \\times P \\times Q (Market \\  potential,Number \\  of \\  possible \\  buyers,Price,annual \\ consumption )$

- Pricing Strategies

  - New product  
  - there are many mechanism to charge money

  1. first detirmine the objective

  2. demand

  3. estimating cost

     - water, electricity, and so on

  4. analyze competitor's

  5. selecting the pricing method

     - based on the objective
     - skiming
       - high setting
       - buyers must want the product at the price
       - for startup, inbounding strategy
     - penetration
       - low settings
       - analyze the market constantly and react quickly
     - line
       - think the line where their product are selling
     - optional
       - additional
       - easy when selling something expensive already
     - captive
       - set a place or system that they can only use your product
       - printer and Desney land
     - two-part
       - fixed fee and usage
     - by-product
       - selling something that has made as a result of the main product
     - bundle
       - value set
     - discount and allowance
       - quantity discount
       - cash discount
       - seasonal discount
       - functional discount(ikea making your furniture)
     - segmented pricing
       - selling in different segment
       - changing the customers and product function could change the price
       - also time: uber at rush time
       - market should be segmentable
     - phycological pricing
     - promotional pricing
       - not all time
       - loss-leader: one product discounting and buys others also
       - cash rebates: 'return 5 dollars!' but nobody do
       - Risks: damaging the brand, price war
       -

     ​

  6. final pricing

- Bussiness model canvas

  - also making a profile of the customer
  - value all of your ploduct and connect to customers pain and gain
  - and for the price, think about how much the customer would put, Price on Value
  - demand and supply
  - Don't promise more than you actually can
  - Alternatives
  - cost
    - fixed cost: even selling nothing
    - variable costs: when sell something
    - economy of scale
  - Diveide in what we konw and what we don't know

##### Why Neural Nets for NLP

- *Graham Neubig* legend of NLP

- level of language

  - morphology(単語) / syntax(order) / semantics(meanings)

- syntax:We can use rules :happy:

- But, every rules have exception

- And, what if we don't know any word of a language?

- Nerural Net is just one of the tools

- Classification

  - 'I hate this movie' and 'I love this movie'
  - Bag of Words **BOW** model: sum of vector
    - but, can't analyze the convination of words such as 'Thers is nothing i don't love about this movie.'
  - Continius Bag of Words **CBOW** model: sum, then multiple a matrix
  - Deeo CBOW: sum → 線形 → tanh → 線形 → tanh → 線形 → result
    - can save the convention and make another cell of the convention not leaner
    - the tanh is the activation function
    - can add a loss function that delite the information that we don't need, for example like the information of race

- New Loss function: if the model is bad, higher

- implementation

  - static: tensorflow,theano, mxnet

    - first decide the all the graph
      - can't do a dinamic framework
      - not good for NLP

  - Dynamic: $\\part y/net$, Chainer, PYTORCH

    - less optimization
    - better for NLP, because can dynamicaly change the parameters numbers

    1. Create a model
    2. create a graph
    3. calculate
    4. back propagation and update
    5. for 2~5, do it on each input

    - defaultdict

    -  loss func: $-\\log$ because when the classification is bad, meaning that the place of the right tag  is near 0, the loss will be very high, while in the opposite it wolud be 0

      \`\`\`python
      w2i = defaultdict(lambda : len(w2i))#add an id to each word, if exist that is in the dict, if not gives a new id
      model = dy.Model()
      trainer = dy. AdamTrainer(model)
      W_sm = model.add_lookup_parameters((nwords,ntags))
      b_sm = model.add_parametors((ntags))
      \`\`\`

##### Simple Exercise for NLP

- Language models
  - rank the language to see which is the most probabl
  - Log-likelihood: $LL(\\varepsilon_{test})=\\sum_{E\\in\\varepsilon_{test}}\\log P(E)$
  - Per-word Log-likelihood: $WLL(\\varepsilon_{test})=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{E\\in\\varepsilon_{test}}|E|}\\sum_{E\\in\\varepsilon_{test}}\\log P(E)$
  - Per word cross entropy: $H(\\varepsilon_{test})=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{E\\in\\varepsilon_{test}}|E|}\\sum_{E\\in\\varepsilon_{test}}-\\log_2 P(E)$
  - Perplexity: $ppl(\\varepsilon_{test})=2^{H(\\varepsilon_{test})}=e^{-WLL(\\varepsilon_{test})}$
  - 'Jane went to the store' → <font color='green'>High</font>
  - 'store to went Jane the' → <font color=red>Low</font>
  - for each order and word make a word vector
  - softmax part is the heaviest
- Unkonwn word
  - Byte per Encoding **BPE**
    - First, divide in every character, then see the character combination and add the most frecuent combination as a new 'character'.
    - I| w|e|n|t   t|o  k|y|o|t|o → to is in everywhere → I| w|e|n|t   <font color='red'>to</font>  k|y|o|t|o
- Non Lenear
  - Use Neural Network
- Training tricks
  - shfful the data
  - other optimizaion
  - Dropout: imitate multy different nural networks
- Batching
  - do the model coputing in parallel:
- word embeddings
  - word2vec
    - kind of language model using predicting the next word, predict the middle word
    - → get
  - distributional
    - similar words appear in similar contexts
    - $\\leftrightarrow$non-distributional ex. math → 算数 and 数学 so 算数 $\\approx$ 数学
  - discriminate

- The Challenge

  - how to grow

- Finish the incubator phase

  - first paying will customor
  - business model
  - Budget Authority Need Timeline **BANT** understanding

- mapping bussiness point

  - Customer
    - who? b or c
    - Who do sign the purchase oder?
  - Contacts
    - decision maker
    - additional (R&D, sales)
    - find with who the decision maker will talk
  - Budget
    - Does the customer have budget? (予算)
    - How to use the existing budget to your purpose.
    - Or there isn't budget, need to find a new 'line'.
  - Regions
    - Where?
    - Try to be focused
  - Partners
    - list of potential partners
    - better to find a way to do your own selling connection
    - if you need partner, just for specific regions
    - maintaining the connection with the partner, not only finding and making a contract

- Selling phases

  - Terms

    - High touch, Mid touch, Low touch,No touch

      - How frecuantly you should have conntact with the customer
      - How much will cost to maintain customers

### 1/2

#### *Roee Aharoni*

- window(how many words you take from after and before the word)

  - small : synthetic

  - large: semantic

- skip-gram

  - take a word a predict the neighbors

- GloVe

  - comparing the probability of the relationship with a word

- linear pca and non-linear t-SNE

- Evaluation type

- Intrinsic: using scores

  - relatedness
  - analogy
  - categorization
  - selectional preferences

- extrinsic : using actual usages

  - Initialize: you can choose if freezing the model while the task or not
  - Concatenate:

- embedding is useful for training with small amount of data

  - some problems
    - bias, same word with different meanings, dog an dogs are too different

- NN for NLP

  - 1D CNN kind of thing
    - can do Bags of n-grams without the explosion of memory
    - also faster because parallelize is able
  - Stacked
    - can save the computation by striding but also can save the information of the entirety sentence
    - relu or soft plus are better
  - Structured convolution
    - using syntax: the relation between words such as Object, 修飾語, ...
  - Using to sentence pairs
    - Q&A
  - CNN is easy to backtrack because you can see where the result came from due to the max pulling. Thus the understanding is better and can implement by analyzing the result
  - Lower the model is better

- RNN

  - Recurrent: Depends on the previous computation
  - Bi-RNN: Not only the previous words, the following words
  - Vanilla RNN problem: Vanishing Gradient, the loss don’t depends on so much on the farer inputs

- LSTM

  - add an linear computation (sum) to a memory cell so to solve the RNN’s problem
  - not so sensitive as RNN
  - LSTM problem
    - too slow
    - solve with mini-batching and Masking
    - or with bucketing and sorting

- Conditional language Model

  1. Encode the sentence (or, what you want to input)
  2. Decode the translation(or what you want to output)

  - Most important NLP model
  - Beam search: select the k best words and for each continue predicting until all end(output \\</s>)

- Ensembling

  - make the probability for each model and compare
  - log-linear  or linear
    - multiplication or adding

- Stacking

  - We have two different models
  - Score the prediction of one of the models on the another
  - We can evaluate the translation using
  - **Expensive one to rerank** because for generating the bigger one takes more time, but you can use it to evaluate and imitate

- Evaluate

  - BLUE
    - count how many n-grams match with the human translation(maybe collected from internet)
  - METEOR
    - use paraphrases, reordering from dictionaries

##### Attention

- Make connection between the words
  - Get the comparison between each word of the translation and all the sentence
  - And learn where to look(translate) next
- Intra-Attention / Self Attention
  - LSTM is too slow
  - So, use only attention
  - For all the words, get all the attention from the other words
  - With only this, we can't differ the position of the words, so...
    - learn a position matrix
    - or use matrix that was made by many frequency $\\sin$s to present the position
- Multi-headed Attention
  - Using more attention methods and
- 'Attention is all you need'
  - Attention layers for the encoder and decoder
  - Fast because can do parallel work using the layers and masking

#### Last Pitching

- Be aware to all the asked question
  - Your and member's background
  - How you came up with the number
- Use all your strength and emphasis in the slide
- Technology problem → Business problem
